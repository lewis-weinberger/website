**Abstract**: We explore a potential new probe of
reionization: the cross-correlation of high-redshift galaxies with maps of
the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. We consider two types of high
redshift galaxies: Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and Lyman-α emitters
(LAEs). LBGs and LAEs will be detected in large numbers at high redshift
(z ~ 4 to 7) by ongoing and future surveys. We consider a LBG sample like
that expected from the The Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and
Time (LSST), and a selection of LAEs modelled after the Subaru SILVERRUSH
program, but covering a much larger sky fraction. The tSZ effect is
sensitive to a line-of-sight integral of the ionized gas pressure, and can
be measured across large patches of the sky using multi-frequency CMB
surveys. We consider forecast tSZ maps from CMB Stage 4 and more
futuristic observations. Using a suite of hydrodynamical simulations, we
show that the high-redshift galaxies are correlated with the tSZ signal
from reionization, with cross-power amplitude of order 10−15 at l∼1000.
The cross-spectra between LBGs/LAEs with tSZ maps contain information
about the reionization history of the Universe, such as the distribution
of bubble sizes, and could in principle be used to directly measure the
timing of reionization. The amplitude of the signal is small, however, and
its detectability is hindered by low-redshift contributions to tSZ maps
and by instrumental noise. If the the low-redshift contribution to the
observed tSZ signal is suppressed by masking of massive halos, a
combination of overlapping futuristic CMB and galaxy surveys could
potentially probe this signal.

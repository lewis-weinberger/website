**Abstract**: We model the transmission of the Lyman-alpha
line through the circum- and intergalactic media around dark matter haloes
expected to host Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) at z > 5.7, using the
high-dynamic-range Sherwood simulations. We find very different CGM
environments around more massive haloes compared to less massive haloes at
these redshifts, which can contribute to a different evolution of the
Lyman-alpha transmission from LAEs within these haloes. Additionally we
confirm that part of the differential evolution could result from bright
LAEs being more likely to reside in larger ionized regions. We conclude
that a combination of the CGM environment and the IGM ionization structure
is likely to be responsible for the differential evolution of the bright
and faint ends of the LAE luminosity function at z > 6. More generally,
we confirm the suggestion that the self-shielded neutral gas in the
outskirts of the host halo can strongly attenuate the Lyman-alpha emission
from high redshift galaxies. We find that this has a stronger effect on
the more massive haloes hosting brighter LAEs. The faint-end of the LAE
luminosity function is thus a more reliable probe of the average
ionization state of the IGM. Comparing our model for LAEs with a range of
observational data we find that the favoured reionization histories are
our previously advocated Late and Very Late reionization histories, in
which reionization finishes rather rapidly at around z > 6.

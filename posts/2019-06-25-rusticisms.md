A small collection of [https://www.rust-lang.org/](Rust) jokes, mostly
found in *Quote of the Week* on
[users.rust-lang.org](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/twir-quote-of-the-week/):

- Failure is not an `Option<T>`, it's a `Result<T>`.
- In Rust, `None` is always an `Option<T>`.
- Rust iterators are the best thing since `&Bread[..]`.

**Abstract**: We model the 21-cm signal and LAE population
evolution during the epoch of reionization in order to predict the
21cm-LAE cross-power spectrum. We employ high-dynamic-range simulations of
the IGM to create models that are consistent with constraints from the
CMB, Lyman-Î± forest and LAE population statistics. Using these models we
consider the evolution of the cross-power spectrum for a selection of
realistic reionization histories and predict the sensitivity of current
and upcoming surveys to measuring this signal. We find that the imprint of
a delayed-end to reionization can be observed by future surveys, and that
strong constraints can be placed on the progression of reionization as
late as z = 5.7 using a Subaru-SKA survey. We make predictions for the
signal-to-noise ratios achievable by combinations of Subaru/PFS with the
MWA, LOFAR, HERA and SKA interferometers for an integration time of 1000
hours. We find that a Subaru-SKA survey could measure the cross-power
spectrum for a late reionization at z = 6.6 with a total signal-to-noise
greater than 5, making it possible to constrain both the timing and bubble
size at the end of reionization. Furthermore, we find that expanding the
current Subaru/PFS survey area and depth by a factor of three would double
the total signal-to-noise.

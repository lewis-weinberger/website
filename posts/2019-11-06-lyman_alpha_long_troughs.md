**Abstract**: A long (110 cMpc/h) and deep absorption
trough in the Lyα forest has been observed extending down to redshift 5.5
in the spectrum of ULAS J0148+0600. Although no Lyα transmission is
detected, Lyβ spikes are present which has led to claims that the gas
along this trough must be ionized. Using high resolution cosmological
radiative transfer simulations in large volumes, we show that in a
scenario where reionization ends late z ~ 5.2, our simulations can
reproduce troughs as long as observed. In this model, we find that the
troughs are caused by islands of neutral hydrogen. Small ionized holes
within the neutral islands allow for the transmission of Lyβ. We have also
modelled the Lyα emitter population around the simulated troughs, and show
that there is a deficit of Lyα emitters close to the trough as is
observed.

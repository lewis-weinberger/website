**Abstract**: We model the high-redshift (z > 5)
Ly α-emitting galaxy (LAE) population using the empirical rest-frame
equivalent width distribution. We calibrate to the observed luminosity
function and angular correlation function at z = 5.7 as measured by the
SILVERRUSH survey. This allows us to populate the high-dynamic-range
Sherwood simulation suite with LAEs, and to calculate the transmission of
their Ly α emission through the intergalactic medium (IGM). We use this
simulated population to explore the effect of the IGM on high-redshift
observations of LAEs, and make predictions for the narrow-band filter
redshifts at z = 6.6, 7.0, and 7.3. Comparing our model with existing
observations, we find a late reionization is suggested, consistent with
the recent low optical depth derived from the cosmic microwave background
by the Planck collaboration and the opacity fluctuations in the Ly α
forest. We also explore the role of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and
the large volume of gas that is infalling on to the host halo versus the
IGM in attenuating the Ly α signal, finding that a significant fraction of
the attenuation is due to the CGM and infalling gas, which increases
towards the end of reionization, albeit with a large scatter across the
mock LAE population.

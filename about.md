I am an [operational researcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research)
and data scientist. (Pronouns: *he, him, his*).

I originally studied Physics at university, completing a PhD in Astrophysics
in 2020 at the University of Cambridge's
[Institute of Astronomy](https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/). My research focused
on the inter-galactic medium (IGM, the stuff *in-between* galaxies), in
particular how this medium evolved alongside galaxies in the early universe.
A lot of this work required High Performance Computing (HPC), running
calculations on [supercomputers](https://www.hpc.cam.ac.uk/).

After this I moved to work in the public sector as an operational researcher,
where I've found I can apply some of the fun analytical parts of Physics to
the "real" world (or at least, a world slightly closer to home!).

Outside of work, I enjoy tinkering with computers and software.
